Feature: UI/UX Requirements
  As a user
  I want a modern, intuitive chat interface
  So that I can communicate efficiently and enjoyably

  Background:
    Given the chat application is running
    And user "alice" with password "SecurePass123!" exists
    And user "bob" with password "SecurePass123!" exists
    And "alice" and "bob" are contacts
    And I am logged in as "alice"

  # Standard Chat UI Layout
  Scenario: Chat interface layout on desktop
    Given I am on the main chat interface on a desktop browser
    Then I should see a chat list panel on the left side
    And I should see a chat messages panel on the right side
    And the chat list should take approximately 30% of the screen width
    And the messages panel should take approximately 70% of the screen width
    And there should be a clear visual separator between the panels

  Scenario: Chat list functionality
    Given I am on the main chat interface
    Then the chat list should show all my contacts
    And the chat list should show all my group chats
    And each chat should display the latest message preview
    And each chat should show the timestamp of the last message
    And unread chats should be visually highlighted
    And the most recent conversations should appear at the top

  Scenario: Message panel layout
    Given I have a chat open with "bob"
    Then the message panel should show a header with "bob"'s name
    And the header should include contact status (online/offline)
    And the message history should be scrollable
    And new messages should appear at the bottom
    And there should be a message input field at the bottom
    And there should be formatting buttons (bold, italic)
    And there should be an image attachment button

  # Responsive Design
  Scenario: Mobile responsive layout
    Given I am using the application on a mobile device
    When I am on the main interface
    Then the chat list should be full-width on the initial view
    And when I select a chat, it should show full-width message view
    And there should be a back button to return to the chat list
    And touch interactions should be optimized for mobile

  Scenario: Tablet responsive layout
    Given I am using the application on a tablet
    When I am in portrait mode
    Then the layout should stack vertically with chat list on top
    When I rotate to landscape mode
    Then the layout should show side-by-side panels like desktop

  Scenario: Responsive message input
    Given I am on any device size
    When I type a long message
    Then the input field should expand vertically as needed
    And the input should never exceed a maximum height
    And a scrollbar should appear for very long messages
    And the send button should always be visible

  # Modern, Intuitive Interface
  Scenario: Visual design consistency
    Given I am using the application
    Then all buttons should have consistent styling
    And the color scheme should be cohesive throughout
    And typography should be consistent and readable
    And there should be appropriate spacing between elements
    And the design should follow modern UI principles

  Scenario: Dark mode support
    Given I am on the application
    When I toggle to dark mode
    Then all interface elements should adapt to dark theme
    And text should remain readable with appropriate contrast
    And the theme preference should be remembered
    And images and icons should work well in dark mode

  Scenario: Accessibility features
    Given I am using the application
    Then all interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
    And there should be appropriate focus indicators
    And text should meet WCAG contrast requirements
    And screen readers should be able to navigate the interface
    And there should be appropriate ARIA labels

  # User Experience Flow
  Scenario: Smooth animations and transitions
    Given I am using the application
    When I switch between chats
    Then the transition should be smooth and fast
    When new messages arrive
    Then they should appear with a subtle animation
    When I hover over interactive elements
    Then there should be appropriate hover states

  Scenario: Loading states and feedback
    Given I am using the application
    When content is loading
    Then I should see appropriate loading indicators
    When I perform an action
    Then I should receive immediate visual feedback
    When an error occurs
    Then I should see clear, actionable error messages

  Scenario: Message status indicators
    Given I send a message to "bob"
    Then I should see a "sending" indicator while uploading
    And I should see a "sent" indicator when delivered to server
    And I should see a "delivered" indicator when bob receives it
    And I should see a "read" indicator when bob reads it

  # Navigation and Usability
  Scenario: Intuitive navigation
    Given I am new to the application
    Then all main functions should be easily discoverable
    And tooltips should be available for less obvious features
    And the interface should follow common chat app conventions
    And there should be keyboard shortcuts for power users

  Scenario: Search interface
    Given I want to search for messages
    When I click the search button
    Then a search bar should appear prominently
    And I should be able to search with autocomplete suggestions
    And search results should be clearly highlighted
    And I should be able to easily clear search and return to normal view

  Scenario: Settings and preferences
    Given I want to customize my experience
    When I access settings
    Then options should be organized in logical categories
    And changes should apply immediately or have clear save/cancel actions
    And I should be able to easily return to previous settings
    And dangerous actions should require confirmation

  # Performance and Responsiveness
  Scenario: Fast interaction response
    Given I am using the application
    When I click on any interactive element
    Then the response should be immediate (< 100ms)
    When I scroll through message history
    Then scrolling should be smooth without lag
    When I type in the message input
    Then characters should appear instantly

  Scenario: Efficient message loading
    Given I have a chat with extensive history
    When I open the chat
    Then recent messages should load immediately
    And older messages should load as I scroll up
    And loading should be seamless without interface blocking
    And there should be visual indication of loading older messages

  Scenario: Optimized for different connection speeds
    Given I am on a slow internet connection
    Then the interface should remain responsive
    And critical features should work even with high latency
    And there should be appropriate feedback for slow operations
    And the app should gracefully handle connection issues
