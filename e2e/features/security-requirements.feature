Feature: Security Requirements
  As a user and system administrator
  I want the chat application to be secure
  So that my communications and data are protected

  Background:
    Given the chat application is running
    And security measures are properly configured

  # Authentication Security
  Scenario: Secure password storage
    Given I register with username "alice" and password "SecurePass123!"
    When the password is stored in the database
    Then it should be hashed using bcrypt or Argon2
    And the original password should not be stored in plain text
    And the salt should be unique for each password

  Scenario: Strong password enforcement
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I try to register with password "123"
    Then I should see an error about password requirements
    And the requirements should include minimum length
    And the requirements should include complexity requirements
    And weak passwords should be rejected

  Scenario: Session security
    Given I am logged into the application
    When a session is created
    Then the session token should be cryptographically secure
    And the session should have an appropriate expiration time
    And the session should be invalidated on logout
    And concurrent sessions should be managed appropriately

  Scenario: Secure authentication endpoint
    Given I make an authentication request
    When providing invalid credentials
    Then the response should not reveal whether username or password was incorrect
    And there should be rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
    And failed login attempts should be logged

  # Authorization and Access Control
  Scenario: Chat access authorization
    Given user "alice" has a private chat with "bob"
    And user "charlie" is not part of this chat
    When "charlie" tries to access the chat
    Then access should be denied
    And "charlie" should not see any chat content
    And the attempt should be logged

  Scenario: Group chat access control
    Given there is a group chat "Private Team" with members "alice" and "bob"
    And "charlie" is not a member
    When "charlie" tries to access the group chat
    Then access should be denied
    And "charlie" should not see group messages
    And group participant list should not be visible to "charlie"

  Scenario: Message access control
    Given "alice" and "bob" have exchanged messages
    When "charlie" tries to access these messages directly
    Then all message content should be inaccessible
    And API endpoints should return appropriate authorization errors
    And no message metadata should be leaked

  # Input Validation and Sanitization
  Scenario: Prevent SQL injection in chat search
    Given I am searching for messages
    When I enter SQL injection code "'; DROP TABLE messages; --"
    Then the input should be safely handled
    And no database queries should be executed from the input
    And the search should return safe results or errors

  Scenario: Prevent XSS in message content
    Given I am sending a message
    When I include script tags "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    Then the script should not execute for recipients
    And the content should be properly escaped or sanitized
    And the message should display safely

  Scenario: File upload security validation
    Given I am uploading an image
    When I try to upload a malicious file disguised as an image
    Then the file type should be properly validated
    And malicious files should be rejected
    And file content should be scanned for threats

  Scenario: Prevent command injection
    Given the application processes user input
    When malicious commands are included in any input field
    Then the commands should not be executed on the server
    And all user inputs should be properly sanitized
    And dangerous characters should be escaped

  # API Security
  Scenario: API authentication required
    Given I make an API request without authentication
    When trying to access protected endpoints
    Then I should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
    And no sensitive data should be returned
    And the request should be logged

  Scenario: API rate limiting
    Given I am making API requests
    When I exceed the rate limit threshold
    Then further requests should be blocked temporarily
    And I should receive appropriate rate limit headers
    And the blocking should be logged

  Scenario: CORS policy enforcement
    Given the application has CORS policies configured
    When a request comes from an unauthorized origin
    Then the request should be blocked
    And appropriate CORS headers should be returned
    And the policy should be consistently enforced

  # Network Security
  Scenario: HTTPS enforcement
    Given I try to access the application over HTTP
    When making any request
    Then I should be redirected to HTTPS
    And all subsequent communication should be encrypted
    And security headers should be present

  Scenario: Secure WebSocket connections
    Given I establish a WebSocket connection
    When the connection is made
    Then it should use WSS (secure WebSocket)
    And the connection should be authenticated
    And unauthorized connections should be rejected

  Scenario: Security headers implementation
    Given I make any request to the application
    Then the response should include security headers:
      | Header | Expected |
      | Content-Security-Policy | Restrictive policy |
      | X-Frame-Options | DENY or SAMEORIGIN |
      | X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff |
      | Strict-Transport-Security | Appropriate max-age |
      | X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block |

  # Data Protection
  Scenario: Sensitive data handling
    Given users have personal information in the system
    When this data is stored or transmitted
    Then personal data should be properly protected
    And sensitive fields should be encrypted at rest
    And data access should be logged and monitored

  Scenario: Secure file storage
    Given users upload images to the chat
    When files are stored in cloud storage
    Then file URLs should not be publicly accessible
    And access should require authentication
    And file URLs should have appropriate expiration times

  Scenario: Data retention and deletion
    Given a user wants to delete their account
    When account deletion is requested
    Then all personal data should be properly removed
    And chat history should be handled according to policy
    And deletion should be irreversible and complete

  # Error Handling Security
  Scenario: Secure error messages
    Given an error occurs in the application
    When displaying error messages to users
    Then error messages should not reveal system internals
    And stack traces should not be exposed to users
    And sensitive information should not be leaked

  Scenario: Logging security events
    Given security-relevant events occur
    When these events happen
    Then they should be properly logged:
      | Event Type | Should Log |
      | Failed login attempts | Yes |
      | Unauthorized access attempts | Yes |
      | File upload attempts | Yes |
      | API rate limit violations | Yes |
      | Session creation/destruction | Yes |

  # Infrastructure Security
  Scenario: Database security
    Given the application connects to the database
    When database operations are performed
    Then connections should use secure protocols
    And database credentials should be properly secured
    And parameterized queries should be used exclusively

  Scenario: Environment security
    Given the application is deployed
    When environment variables contain secrets
    Then secrets should not be exposed in logs
    And configuration should follow security best practices
    And default passwords should be changed

  # Session Management
  Scenario: Session timeout
    Given I am logged into the application
    When I remain idle for the configured timeout period
    Then my session should automatically expire
    And I should be logged out securely
    And I should need to re-authenticate

  Scenario: Concurrent session handling
    Given I am logged in from one device
    When I log in from another device
    Then the system should handle multiple sessions securely
    And I should have the option to terminate other sessions
    And session conflicts should be managed appropriately

  # Privacy and Compliance
  Scenario: Message privacy
    Given users exchange private messages
    When messages are stored and transmitted
    Then message content should be encrypted in transit
    And message storage should be secure
    And unauthorized access should be prevented

  Scenario: User privacy controls
    Given I want to control my privacy
    When I access privacy settings
    Then I should be able to control who can contact me
    And I should be able to control visibility of my information
    And privacy preferences should be respected throughout the system
